# personal-wiki
A personal wiki for various development ideas/paradigms i want to document.

## Static Websits
For now.... I just use Netlify.
Preferred framework for static sites? I dunno.

## DevOps Pipeline
 * Build: TravisCI? CircleCI?
 
 

 
## Thoughts
 Instead of having Netlify & Serverless, maybe standardize on Serverless framework for small apps (eg. HTTP APIs) & static websites (like gatsby) to deploy to AWS or GCP.
 
## Devops Frameworks

Initially, I thought pulumi was the best approach, but, since there’s a lot of interest
In cdk, I should try that. But then again work mostly uses terraform. So I’ll need to pick one really, I don’t need a dozen. Then I’ll document that here and why, (and why not others), unless there’s a good reason to use them, it makes sense to standardize.
 
 
## Infra
 * Mainly, I've just been using AWS, though I have some experiments into GCP, very little in Azure.
