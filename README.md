# personal-wiki
A personal wiki for various development ideas/paradigms i want to document.

## Static Websits
For now.... I just use Netlify.
Preferred framework for static sites? I dunno.

## DevOps Pipeline
 * Build: TravisCI? CircleCI?
 
 
## Thoughts
 Instead of having Netlify & Serverless, maybe standardize on Serverless framework for small apps (eg. HTTP APIs) & static websites (like gatsby) to deploy to AWS or GCP.
 
 
## Infra
 * Mainly, I've just been using AWS, though I have some experiments into GCP, very little in Azure.
